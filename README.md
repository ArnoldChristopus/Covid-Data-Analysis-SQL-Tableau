# Overview
This project integrates multiple tools. Data was collected using the selenium library in Jupyter Notebook because the content is dynamic.
Data cleaning and exploration was performed using SQL, heavily focusing on the cleaning part by altering and updating the tables. The analysis also involved creating a custom function for repeatability.
The analysis was then imported to Tableau for building interactive dashboard.
Static dashboard can bew viewed in the image folder while the interactive dashboard can be viewed in Tableau Public here [https://public.tableau.com/views/Book2_16437448511740/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link]

# Data
The data was collected by web scraping from these [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/], [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL].
Note: The website structure has since changed, so the scraping code may no longer work as-is. The included dataset was scraped when the code was functional and is used for demonstration purposes. The scraped data can be found in the data folder or can be found publicly here [https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations].

# Tools
Jupyter Notebook is used for data collection, SQL is used for data exploration, and Tableau is used for visualization.
